Development environment setup after a clean Mac OS install
===================

This is what is use as a playground. I mainly do full stack js with react / meteor / raw node and sometimes ember. I also go for some mative apps ios/android some go and some rust. Sometimes python and some PHP legacy code. Mongo Aerospike and sql for databases.

At first, check updates via the appstore.

> To add a temporary directory to the PATH, run `export PATH="__folder__:$PATH"` ; to add a permanent directory to the PATH, `nano ~/zshrc` and add `export PATH="__folder__:$PATH"`

Display hidden folders :
* run `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES`
* run `killall Finder` to restart the finder

## Get the `/usr/local` ownership

  sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local

> This will make you owner of your /usr/local folder. [Important for npm use.](http://foohack.com/2010/08/intro-to-npm/#what_no_sudo) and necessary for proper homebrew use.

## Install your package manager: Homebrew

This will help installing command line programs. 

Run: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

On a mac, you have ruby.

> Don't `sudo`. You have the ownership of your `/usr/local` folder.

Install a few packages :

* `brew install git`
* `brew install wget`
* `brew install mysql`
* `brew install mongo`
* `brew install yarn` => replacement for the npm command
* `brew install nvm`=> node version manager <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>

> nvm is super important, you should install node with nvm to be able to manage your node versions

## Configure Git

You installed it with `brew install git`. Now, configure your git credentials :

    git config --global user.name "fabien"
    git config --global user.email "fabien.huet@gmail.com"

Create SSH key (with no passphrase, this is just a useless pain):

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "fabien.huet@gmail.com"

Then copy it with :

    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Then add it to github, bitbucket, gitlab... accounts.

Make git case sensitive

	git config --global core.ignorecase false

## Get a better terminal

1. Install iterm 2 <http://www.iterm2.com/> , then open preferences
2. Uncheck « Native full screen windows » in « General »
3. Add ctrl + esc as hotkey to make it appear in « Keys »
4. Go full screen ( cmd + return )
5. Install oh-my-zsh : `curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh` and restart the terminal
6. Make it Launch on startup in `/system preferences/Users & Groups/Login Items`
7. In the iterm menu /Iterm2/Make Iterm2 default term
8. Download and install the patched version of inconsolata from [powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
9. Set it as default font for ascii and non ascii characters (12pt) in your iterm prefrences/Profiles/Text/Change font
10. Install [agnosterzak](https://github.com/zakaziko99/agnosterzak-ohmyzsh-theme) and set `ZSH_THEME="agnosterzak"` in `~/.zshrc` (`nano ~/.zshrc` to start editing) and add the custom fonts
11. Install Mac port to get the linux commands : <https://www.macports.org/>
12. pick a colour theme : <http://iterm2colorschemes.com/> (« Solarized Dark Higher Contrast" or « Ocean")

## Install broswers

Get chrome and firefox. Add some extensions to chrome :

* ublock origin
* advanced rest client
* livereload
* markdown here
* page speed
* panda
* distractoff
* lighthouse

## Install node

There are many ways to install node. The easiest is to use the .pkg. Go to <https://nodejs.org/en/>

## Install some global packages

These are some of the packages you may need:

* Install tldr : `npm install -g tldr` => this is a nice community managed man page simplificator <https://tldr.sh/>
* Install compass and sass : `gem install compass` => even if you use libsass most of the time
* Install gulp : `npm i -g gulp`
* Install grunt : `npm i -g grunt`
* Install bower : `npm i -g bower`
* Install webpack : `npm i -g webpack`
* Install yeoman : `npm i -g yo`
* Install eslint : `npm install -g eslint` => <https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint>
* Install meteor : `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

## Install MAMP

Because sometimes, you will need PHP. <http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/>

## Install Docker

Go to https://hub.docker.com/

Start it and go configure it. Allow at least 2 cores and 6 Go (8 is better).

## Create a partition for your projects

MacOs is not case sensitive by default. So you have to create a partition dedicated to your projects.

Give yourself at least a 100 Go APFS case sensitive partition.

## Get your editor ready: VSCode

Get VSCode : <https://code.visualstudio.com/>.

Add some extensions:

* Prettier https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
* Chrome debugger https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome
* ESLint https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
* TSLint https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint
* StyleLint https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shinnn.stylelint
* Docker https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker
* C/C++ https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools

Setup the command line launcher : Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and type `shell command` to find the Shell Command: Install `code` command in PATH command. You can then `code .` to open the current directory in VSCode.

### Xcode

You need Xcode. Like it or not. Not only to build iOs / MacOs apps. But also for the command line developper tools. So go there install and accept the licence : <https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/xcode>.

Note that this is from far the best way to preview a website design on an iphone or an ipad. There are many problem you will just never encounter in chrome that you need to adress. The simulator is perfect for that.
